# mundolinguo
Attempts to make up a new language based on Esperanto grammar as well as words from multiple real-world languages. 

To Esperantists
===============

This attempt of building a new language is not intent to challange / compete with Esperanto. 
As a fina-venkisto, I believe Esperanto is the artificial language to popularize (as ``nia lingvo''). 
On the contrast, mia lingvo serves the following purposes: 
1. To understand Dr. Zamenhof's design, in a parallel manner of trail and error. 
The mundolinguo is definitively much inferior to Esperanto, and will not be so influncing. 
However, in making up the language, one faces the challenge of merging words from various existing languages into a self-consistent artifical language. 
With such attemptions, one does not need to doubt the etomology of Esperanto words; nor one tries to ``improve'' the basic vocabulary. 
1. To provide an alternative man-made language scarcely embedded in Esperanto text. 
Perhaps it is useful in fictional writing. 
1. To try specified-language-oriented computer software. 
If such development succeeds, it is rather easy to port it for Esperanto as computerized supports.
