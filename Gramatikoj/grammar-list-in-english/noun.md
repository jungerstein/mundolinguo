Orthography
===========
1. Nouns are always written with the first letter capitialized. 
1. For respectful uses, small capitals of following letters are favoured. 
1. All nouns ends with -o in singular nominative. 

Cases
=====
1. Mundolinguo nouns must inflect according to cases, and to numbers (prescribed later). 
1. There is only one set of inflection rules in Mundolinguo. 
1. The cases are
    1. Nominative 
    1. Genitive (Active / Passive / Possessive)
    1. Dative
    1. Accusative
1. The singular endings are
    1. Nominative: -o
    1. Genitive
        1. Active genitive: -ox
        1. Passive genitive: -oc
        1. Possessive genitive: -os; They are designed to sound alike so that in quick speech one could do not have to distinguish them. 
    However, in written Mundolinguo they must be distinguished. 
    1. Dative: -om
    1. Accusative: -on

Different Types of Genitives
----------------------------
1. There are 3 types of genitives for a Mundolingo noun. 
    1. The __active genitive__ ends with __-x__, referring to actions / things
       made by the genetive noun. 
    1. The __passive genitive__ ends with __-c__, referring to actions / things
       suffered / received by the genetive noun. 
    1. The __possive genitive__ ends with __-s__, referring to actions / things
       possessed by the genetive noun. 
1. If one does not need to distinguish the types of genitives in the context, 
   the _possive genitive_ is preferred. 
1. In spoken Mundolingo where the types of genitives do not mean a lot, 
   the _possive genitive_ is spoken; the three endings sound alike, 
   and any type is acceptable. 
1. Example
    1. For "Mario's love"
        1. Mariox Amo, which means Mario loves someone. 
        1. Marioc Amo, which means someone loves Mario. 
        1. Marios Amo, which refers to _love_ per se as a quality that Mario has. 

Numbers
=======
1. Plural nouns must bear the sign -j-. 
1. Hence, the plural endings are -oj, -ojx, -ojc, -ojs, -ojm, -ojn. 
1. Plural is used after a cardinal number different from the exact integer 1 expressed as the integer per se. Hence in Mundolingo one says
    * 2 Maloj 
    * 5 Maloj 
    * 21 Maloj 
    * 0 Maloj 
    * 1,4 Maloj 
    * 1,00000 Maloj 
    * -1 Maloj 
    * 1/1 Maloj (as a fraction) 
    * 1 Malo
