Personal Pronouns
=================
1. The basic personal pronouns are (in nomitive)

Person | Gender | Singular | Plural
-------|--------|----------|-------
I      | All    | ĵe       | nos
II     | All    | te       | vos
III    | Masc   | li       | ili
III    | Fem    | ŝi       | ili
III    | Neut   | ĝi       | ili

1. The pronouns also inflect. 
1. For accusative, an -n is added; for dative, an -m is added. 
1. For genitive, use -ax, -ac, -as. 
    1. They are not adjectives, nor adjective-like, so they cannot further inflect. 
    1. The accusative of my night is not ĵeasn Nokton, but ĵeas Nokton. 
    1. That differs from those in most European languages. 
  
Reflective Pronouns 
===================
1. The reflective pronoun **si** is used for __all__ persons. 
1. Si inflects as li. 
1. Examples
    1. I took off my coat at once. --> _Ĵe soforte fanhakis **sias** Mantŭon_. Not _Ĵe soforte fanhakis **ĵeas** Mantŭon_.
