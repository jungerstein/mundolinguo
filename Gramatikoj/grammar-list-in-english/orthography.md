Alphabet
--------

The mundolinguo has 35 letters. They are, in order, 
     
 A a | B b | C c | Ĉ ĉ | D d 
-----|-----|-----|-----|-----
 E e | F f | G g | Ĝ ĝ | H h
 Ĥ ĥ | I i | J j | Ĵ ĵ | K k 
 L l | M m | N n | Ñ ñ | O o 
 P p | Q q | R r | S s | Ŝ ŝ
 T t | U u | Ŭ ŭ | V v | W w 
 X x | Y y | Z z | Æ æ | Ø ø 

W w is only reserved for transcriptions; no native words use w. 

Collocation is always in this order above. 

Archaic writings use the letters with circumflex as well: ^d, ^k, ^t, ^z. 
^D collocates right after D and before E, 
^K right after K and before L, 
^T right after T and before U, 
^Z right after Z and before Æ. 

The letters have their own names. Most names are from a noun starting 
with the letter, but with a "xo" suffix.
