Orthography
===========

Alphabet
--------

The mundolinguo has 35 letters. They are, in order, 
     
 A a | B b | C c | Ĉ ĉ | D d 
-----|-----|-----|-----|-----
 E e | F f | G g | Ĝ ĝ | H h
 Ĥ ĥ | I i | J j | Ĵ ĵ | K k 
 L l | M m | N n | Ñ ñ | O o 
 P p | Q q | R r | S s | Ŝ ŝ
 T t | U u | Ŭ ŭ | V v | W w 
 X x | Y y | Z z | Æ æ | Ø ø 

W w is only reserved for transcriptions; no native words use w. 

Collocation is always in this order above. 

Archaic writings use the letters with circumflex as well: ^d, ^k, ^t, ^z. 
^D collocates right after D and before E, 
^K right after K and before L, 
^T right after T and before U, 
^Z right after Z and before Æ. 

The letters have their own names. Most names are from a noun starting 
with the letter, but with a "xo" suffix. 

Asroxo  | Baŭmoxo | Capitoxo | Ĉunoxo | Dioxo  |
--------|---------|----------|--------|--------|
Elekroxo| Fejoxo  | Genoxo   | Ĝaŭkoxo| Haneoxo|
Ĥyanoxo | Iloxo   | Jepoxo   | Ĵeoxo  | Kemuroxo|
Laktoxo | Mundoxo | Nebloxo  | Ñyetoxo| Oroxo  |
Plejnoxo| Qioxo   | Ritoxo   | Sunaoxo| Ŝitoxo |
Tjenoxo | Unŝoxo  | Ŭñxo     | Vejoxo | Ŝŭañvejoxo|
Xinoxo  | Yxo     | Zukoxo   | Æxo    | Øxo    |

TODO: Names for the archaic letters. 

### Ersatz-forms

1. When ^d, ^k, and ^t are not available (e.g. in Unicode), use respectively Θθ, Ǩǩ, and Þþ. 
1. The circumflux can be written __in front of__ the base-letter in question. 
1. Æ æ can be replaced by Ä ä, and Ø ø can be replaced by Ö ö or Œ œ. 
1. When only basic Latin letters are available, the circumfluxed letters are converted to upper-case; if it is upper-cased, double it. 
1. When only upper-case Latin letters are available, use the tri-graph forms below: 
  * Ĉ = CXC
  * ^D = DXD
  * Ĝ = GXG
  * Ĥ = _XHX_    That is different. 
  * Ĵ = _XJX_    Also different. 
  * ^K = KXK
  * Ñ = _GNG_
  * Ŝ = SXS
  * ^T = TXT
  * Ŭ = _UWU_
  * Æ = EAE
  * Ø = EOE

Capitalization
--------------

1. The first letter in a sentence is always capitalized. 
1. The first letter of a noun is always capitalized. 

Sound of Letters
----------------
1. Letters from Esperanto sound as in Esperanto. 
1. New letter Ñ can be pronounced (1) either as Chinese ng in deng, or 
   English ng in sing, or German ng in Klang (but not as in klingen); 
   (2) or as French gn in montagne, or Italian gn in ogni, or Spanish ñ
   in año. 
1. New letter Q shall be rendered as Mandarin Chinese q in qi ; an 
   alternative rendering as Ĉ shall also be accepted, yet in spelling
   no confusion between the both letters is allowed. 
1. New letter W is not used in any ``native'' word. 
1. New letter X shall be rendered as Mandarin Chinese x in xi ; an
   alternative rendering as Ŝ shall also be accepted, yet in spelling
   no confusion between the both letters is allowed. 
1. New letter Y shall be rendered as Mandarin Chinese yu, or French huit, 
   or German ü in über. 
1. New letter Æ shall be rendered as German ä in fährt, or Danish æ in æble. 
1. New letter Ø shall be rendered as French œ in cœur, or German ö in öffnen, 
   or Danish ø in dør. 
1. In ``native'' words, the letters A, E, I, O, U, Y, Æ, and Ø are considered
   as vowels; J, and Ŭ are always consonances. 
1. In variants that use W, the letter W can be rendered either as a vowel
   or as a consonance; yet the usage shall be consistent. 

Spelling Rules
--------------

1. Do not put three consonants together. If a compound word will have three consonants
   together, always add a hyphen therein; elsewhere, spellings must be simplified, 
   and only the first and last consonant shall remain, e.g. GR astro -> asro. 
   * However, ŭ, and j do not count as a consonant in this rule. 
1. When i, and u meet adjacently in _one syllable_, always __change i to j__, and __keep u__. 
   That means always spelling as ju, uj ; instead of iŭ, ŭi. 

Syllables and Accents
---------------------

1. One vowel forms and only forms one syllable. 
   * E.g. kŭatro is two syllables kŭat-ro, and if it were spelt as kuatro, there would be three syllables ku-at-ro. 
   * E.g. Tabioreno is five syllables ta-bi-o-re-no. If it were spelt as Tabjoreno, there would be four: ta-bjo-re-no. 
1. One syllable has a single final-consonant and a single initial-consonant whenever possible. 
   * E.g. kŭatro is kŭat-ro, not kŭa-tro. 
   * E.g. kast has to be kast. However, Mundolingŭo word forming evades the case for most times. 
   * J and ŭ do not count as final-constant here. 
1. Preferably break between two non-j-ŭ-consonants. E.g. kŭatro is kŭat-ro, not kŭa-tro. 
1. Do not break j or ŭ from the vowel directly before it, unless in the case of the following statement. 
   * E.g. oja is oj-a, not o-ja. 
1. If j or ŭ does not have a vowel directly before it, but have one directly after it, do not break inbetween. 
   * E.g. kjal is kjal, not kj-al. 
   * It is a simple conclusion from the rule of one vowel, one syllable. 
   * However, when there is still j or ŭ directly after the vowel, the break must be there if it is necessary to break syllables. 
      * E.g. kjaj (no necessarity to break), kja-ja (need to break), kŭaj, kŭa-ja, kjaŭ, kja-ŭø, kŭøŭ, kŭø-ŭæ. 
1. Do not break non-j-ŭ-consonant + j/ŭ + vowel unless no other possibilities exist. 
   * E.g. Karnjo is kar-njo, Sañŭo is sa-ñŭo. 
1. Do break j/ŭ + non-j-ŭ-consonant + vowel after j or ŭ unless it violates other rules. 
   * E.g. bajka is baj-ka, not bajk-a (though in the source language the form _bajk_ is a word). 
1. Accents always fall on the last second syllable. 
   * If the accent has to be fall otherwise, the acute accent must be written out e.g. kákaka, kakaká. 
   * When introducing new words, try to arrange the spelling so that the accents fall on the last second syllable. 
   * The accents are put word-widely even in compound words: kakáka + ta = kakakáta, not kakákatá. 
     * In multi-part compound words, the part accents can be kept as _weaker_ than the main accent if no violations. 
     * Violation means 
       1. Break other spelling rules. 
       1. Move the main accent. 
       1. Have two accented syllables in one part. 
       
       E.g. kakáka + táta + pa = kakàkatatápa, but not kakàkatàtápa, not kakàkatàtapá. 
1. Break syllables despite the boundary of compound parts. Kŭatrosto (400) is __read as__ kŭat-ros-to, not kŭat-ro-sto. 
1. When breaking lines, use boundary of compound parts, and then syllables breakings within each part. Kŭatrosto is __broken between lines as__ kŭat-ro-sto, not as the reading kŭat-ros-to. 

Words from Japanese
-------------------

Most verbs come from Japanese. The rules for verbs are

1. For 4-dan verbs, k-, s-, n-, r- verbs: change (or retain) the final 
letter to i. 

1. For 2-dan verbs and 1-dan verbs: do not use the form with -ru; remove
-ru, and then change (or retain) the final letter of the remaining part to
i. 

1. Never use rendaku.  

1. Use archaic kana-dukapi. Write p- for h- sound amid and at end of a word. 
Keep uj, ŭe and uo. 

1. For the final letter, write s- for sa-gjau, c- for ta-gjau, z- for za-gjau, d- for da-gjau. 

1. For other letters, write ŝi for si, ĉi for ti, cu for tu, ĵi for zi, 
  di for di, and du for du. 

The rules for adjectives follow ones for verbs, but

1. For -ŝi (modern -i, -ŝi) words, write -ŝa for Mundolinguo dictionary form. 

1. For -nari (modern -na) words, write -nara for Mundolinguo dictionary form. 

Punctuations
------------
* The punctuations are named as: 

1. TODO

* High punctuations are

1. TODO

before and after a high punctuation, a space (or linebreak if before ¿¡, or after other high punctuations) must be present.
