Word Forming
============

Basic Rules
-----------
1. A compound word is composed by putting the __full forms__ of each part-word. 
The endings shall not be omitted. For example, _manabi_ (to learn) and _Libro_ (book) can be joined to mean _Manab**i**libro_ (textbook). 
1. Of course, the part of speech of a compound word is the same as the last part. 
1. If the part of speech shall be changed, the meaning of the compound word is regarded as a whole. 
For example, _manabilibra_ means some characteristics of a textbook, not _manabi_ + _libra_. 
  1. TODO: How to distinguish (manabi + libr)a and (manabi + libra)
